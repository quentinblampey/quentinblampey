I'm developing deep learning tools on multi-omics data for precision medicine in oncology.
I have a particular focus on spatial omics data with single-cell resolution 🧬

### Main projects
- [novae](https://github.com/MICS-Lab/novae): Graph-based foundation model for spatial transcriptomics data. [Nature Methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-025-02899-6)
- [sopa](https://github.com/gustaveroussy/sopa): Technology-invariant pipeline for spatial omics analysis that scales to millions of cells. [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48981-z)
- [scyan](https://github.com/MICS-Lab/scyan): Biology-driven deep generative model for cell-type annotation in cytometry. [Briefings in Bioinformatics](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/24/5/bbad260/7231520)
- [spatialdata](https://github.com/scverse/spatialdata) (***contributor***): An open and interoperable data framework for spatial omics data.
