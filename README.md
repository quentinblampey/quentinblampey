<h2>Hi, I'm Quentin ðŸ‘‹</h2>

<p>I'm developing deep learning tools on multi-omics data for precision medicine in oncology. I have a particular focus on spatial omics data with single-cell resolution.</p>

### Main packages
- [sopa](https://github.com/gustaveroussy/sopa): Technology-invariant pipeline for spatial omics analysis that scales to millions of cells
- [novae](https://github.com/MICS-Lab/novae): Graph-based foundation model for spatial transcriptomics data
- [scyan](https://github.com/MICS-Lab/scyan): Biology-driven deep generative model for cell-type annotation in cytometry
- [spatialdata](https://github.com/scverse/spatialdata) (contributor): An open and interoperable data framework for spatial omics data
